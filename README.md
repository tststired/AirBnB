## Airbnb 

This clone of AirBrB project involves building a feature-rich, single-page ReactJS application for a property rental platform inspired by Airbnb. The frontend interacts with a RESTful API and supports functionalities such as user authentication (login, registration, logout), property listing management (creating, editing, publishing, and deleting listings), and a public landing page showcasing searchable and filterable property listings. Users can view detailed property information, book stays, and leave reviews. Hosts can manage booking requests, view profits, and track booking history. Advanced features include rating breakdowns, profit graphs, JSON-based listing uploads, and support for YouTube video thumbnails. Thorough component and UI testing, adherence to accessibility standards, and a clean, user-friendly design are emphasized to meet modern expectations.

## Getting Started

Navigate to the `frontend` folder and run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies necessary to run the ReactJS app. Then run `npm start` to start the ReactJS app.

To run the backend server, simply run `npm start` in the `backend` directory. This will start the backend.

To view the API interface for the backend you can navigate to the base URL of the backend (e.g. `http://localhost:5005`). This will list all of the HTTP routes that you can interact with.
